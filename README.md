   Problem Statement
------------------------------------------------------
India’s exports are in greater demand as the Indian community in Canada expands.
However, there aren’t many retailers who in the market that import and sell these products,
making it difficult for buyers to buy a certain item because they have to visit each store
separately since not all of them stock that item. Also, it is challenging to visit each store
because it takes a lot of time and is difficult to commute to because of their location. The
fact that a newcomer is unfamiliar with the area and with public transportation can make it
difficult for them to visit these shops.


  Problem Solution
-------------------------------------------------------
We propose creating a website that will offer a platform for searching all the items in one
location, allowing clients to browse products from various categories in accordance with
their needs and quickly make purchases using our website. They won’t have to visit each
store separately because of our website, saving them both time and money.
